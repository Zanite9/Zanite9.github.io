      <h2>Incredible Animals</h2>
      <p>During my nature travels, Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of spotting many different animals. Some were bold, approaching without fear, while others were shy and elusive.</p>

      <h3>Birds</h3>
      <p>From vibrant bluejays to majestic eagles, the variety of bird species was astounding. Their songs added melody to the landscapes.
        Pictured here is a wild heron I came across during a walk.

      <h3>Mammals</h3>
      <p>This is a picture of my dear cat, her name is Ahana. She is climbing a tree in my backyard and this image of her shows how majestic this furry little creature can be.
        I put an airtag on her collar just to be safe, because the outdoors are dangerous to pets!

      <h3>Amphibians</h3>
      <p>While sitting near a river, I came across a beautiful frog, a reminder of how diverse the world can be. I hope the little guy is enjoying life.</p>
